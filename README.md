An interactive Streamlit app that demonstrates a simple LSTM-based predictive text model, trained on Sherlock Holmes stories (public domain text from Project Gutenberg 📖).

Users can type any sentence, and the model will suggest the next few words just like a predictive keyboard ✍️.

🚀 Demo Features
✅ Real-time next-word suggestions
✅ Type-based autocomplete for sentences
✅ Simple LSTM neural network built with PyTorch
✅ Training on Sherlock Holmes text
✅ Configurable training and prediction settings via sidebar
✅ Beautiful Streamlit-based UI with emoji headers and interactive buttons
